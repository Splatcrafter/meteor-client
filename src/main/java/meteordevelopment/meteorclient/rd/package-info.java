/**
 * This package contains classes from the "Redstone Client".
 * <p>
 * The Redstone Client is a Minecraft mod that is a fork of the Meteor Client.
 * It is a mod that is used for cheating in Minecraft.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * It has been modified to include additional features and changes that are not present in the original Meteor Client.
 * This distribution is not affiliated with the Meteor Development team and will never be.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Modifications in the original Meteor Client MUST be visible in the source.
 * Here is an example for comments where the Redstone Client modifies the Meteor Client:
 * <pre>
 *         // Redstone Client start
 *         final boolean example = true;
 *         // Redstone Client end
 *         final int a = 1;
 *         final int b = 2;
 *         final int c = 3;
 *
 *         public void foo() {
 *         // ...
 *         }
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     With this example, it is clear where the Redstone Client modifies the Meteor Client.
 *     This is important for transparency and to comply with the GNU General Public License v3.0.
 *     The GNU General Public License v3.0 requires that the source code of the modified version is visible.
